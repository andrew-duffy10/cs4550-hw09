Web Dev Spring 2021 HW09 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Andrew Duffy

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?



3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

http://events-spa.duffycs.org

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

No. Unfortunately, I ran out of time this week and was only able to get part way through this assignment. In its current version, my single-page react app successfully accesses Users and Events that are stored on the Phoenix server (using redux) and displays them to the user. I focused on this functionality because the react-phoenix communication seemed to be the *crux of the assignment, but I know I'm missing a number of features. 


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

Yes
